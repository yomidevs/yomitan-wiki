Although everything \"just works\" in Chrome, depending on settings, Firefox users can run into problems due to browser bugs. Yomitan catches errors and tries to offer suggestions about how to work around Firefox issues, but in general at least one of the following solutions should work for you:</p> <ul> <li>Make sure you have cookies enabled. It appears that disabling them also disables IndexedDB for some reason. You   can still have cookies be disabled on other sites; just make sure to add the Yomitan extension to the whitelist of   whatever tool you are using to restrict cookies. You can get the extension \"URL\" by looking at the address bar when   you have the search page open.</li> <li>Make sure that you have sufficient disk space available on the drive Firefox uses to store your user profile.   Firefox limits the amount of space that can be used by IndexedDB to a small fraction of the disk space actually   available on your computer.</li> <li>Make sure that you have history set to \"Remember history\" enabled in your privacy settings. When this option is   set to \"Never remember history\", IndexedDB access is once again disabled for an inexplicable reason.</li> <li>As a last resort, try using the Refresh Firefox   feature to reset your user profile. It appears that the Firefox profile system can corrupt itself preventing   IndexedDB from being accessible to Yomitan.</li> </ul> <p>Will you add support for online dictionaries?</p> <p>Online dictionaries will not be implemented because it is not possible to support them in a robust way. In order to perform deinflection, Yomitan must execute dozens of database queries for every single word. Factoring in network latency and the fragility of web scraping, it would not be possible to maintain a good and consistent user experience.</p> <p>Is it possible to use Yomitan with files saved locally on my computer with Chrome?</p> <p>In order to use Yomitan with local files in Chrome, you must first tick the Allow access to file URLs checkbox for Yomitan on the extensions page. In addition, you may use the Yomitan PDF Viewer to view and scan PDF files that are on your local machine.</p> <p>Is it possible to delete individual dictionaries without purging the database?</p> <p>Yomitan is able to delete individual dictionaries, but keep in mind that this process can be very slow and can cause the browser to become unresponsive. The time it takes to delete a single dictionary can sometimes be roughly the same as the time it originally took to import, which can be significant for certain large dictionaries.</p> <p>Why aren't EPWING dictionaries bundled with Yomitan?</p> <p>The vast majority of EPWING dictionaries are proprietary, so they are unfortunately not able to be included in this extension due to copyright reasons.</p>"},{"location":"supported-languages/","title":"Supported Languages","text":"<p>Yomitan supports a variety of languages, although the level of support may vary depending on the extent to which deinflections and text transforms have been implemented.</p> <p>These are the languages currently supported by Yomitan:</p> Language Code Albanian sq Ancient Greek grc Arabic ar Cantonese yue Chinese zh Danish da Dutch nl English en Finnish fi French fr German de Greek el Hungarian hu Indonesian id Italian it Japanese ja Khmer km Korean ko Lao lo Latin la Mongolian mn Old Irish sga Persian fa Polish pl Portuguese pt Romanian ro Russian ru Serbo-Croatian sh Spanish es Swedish sv Tagalog tl Thai th Turkish tr Vietnamese vi <p>If you want to add or improve support for a language, consider looking at the language features documentation at GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"tools-resources/","title":"Tools & Resources","text":"<p>A compiled list of tools and resources that improve your Yomitan experience.</p>"},{"location":"tools-resources/#media-players","title":"Media players","text":"<p>Media players load and play media and enable Yomitan lookups.</p>"},{"location":"tools-resources/#asbplayer","title":"Asbplayer","text":"<p>A browser-based media player and Chrome extension that can add text-selectable and Yomitan-scannable subtitles onto video sources (e.g. Netflix, Youtube, and video files).</p>"},{"location":"tools-resources/#animecards-guide-for-mpv","title":"AnimeCards Guide for MPV","text":"<p>A guide for adding text-selectable subtitles and mining from the MPV video player</p>"},{"location":"tools-resources/#readers","title":"Readers","text":"<p>Readers allow reading books and text on your browser which makes the text you read Yomitan-compatible.</p>"},{"location":"tools-resources/#ttsu-reader","title":"Ttsu Reader","text":"<p>A minimal e-book reader that loads HTMLZ, Plain Text and EPUB files.
