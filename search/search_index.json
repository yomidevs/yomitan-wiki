In these cases, the dictionaries that Yomitan uses will likely not contain diacritics, but the text may contain them. To handle this, we use a diacritics removal preprocessor.</p> <p>This kind of text processing is to a degree interdependent with the dictionaries available for the language.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/language-features/#deinflection-rules-aka-language-transforms","title":"Deinflection Rules (a.k.a. Language Transforms)","text":"<p>Deinflection is the process of converting a word to its base or dictionary form. For example, \"running\" would be deinflected to \"run\". This is useful for finding the word in the dictionary, as well as helping the user understand the grammar (morphology) of the language.</p> <p>These grammatical rules are located in files such as <code>english-transforms.js</code>.</p> <p>Not all the grammatical rules of a language can or need to be implemented in the transforms file. Even a little bit goes a long way, and you can always add more rules later. For every couple rules you add, write some tests in the respective file (see the writing tests section below). This will help you verify that your rules are correct, and make sure nothing is accidentally broken along the way.</p> <p>Transforms files should export a <code>LanguageTransformDescriptor</code>, which is then imported in <code>language-descriptors.js</code>.</p> language-transformer.d.ts<pre><code>export type LanguageTransformDescriptor = {\n    language: string;\n    conditions: ConditionMapObject;\n    transforms: {\n        [name: string]: Transform;\n    };\n};\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>language</code> is the ISO code of the language</li> <li><code>conditions</code> are an object containing parts of speech and grammatical forms that are used to check which deinflections make sense. They are referenced by the deinflection rules.</li> <li><code>transforms</code> are the actual deinflection rules</li> </ul> <p>Let's try and write a bit of deinflection for English, from scratch.</p> english-transforms.js<pre><code>import { suffixInflection } from \"../language-transforms.js\";\n\nexport const englishTransforms = {\n  language: \"en\",\n  conditions: {},\n  transforms: {\n    plural: {\n      name: \"plural\",\n      description: \"Plural form of a noun\",\n      rules: [suffixInflection(\"s\", \"\", [], [])],\n    },\n  },\n};\n</code></pre> <p>This is a simple example for English, where the only deinflection rule is to remove the \"s\" from the end of a noun to get the singular form. The <code>suffixInflection</code> function is a helper that creates a deinflection rule for a suffix. It takes the suffix to remove, what to replace it with, and two more parameters for conditions, which we will look at next. The <code>suffixInflection</code> is the most common type of deinflection rule across languages. The inner <code>plural</code> is the displayed description while looking up, and the outer <code>plural</code> is a name only to be referenced internally within the file.</p> <p>For the input string \"cats\", the following strings will be looked up:</p> <ul> <li><code>cats</code> (no deinflection)</li> <li><code>cat</code> (deinflected by the <code>plural</code> rule)</li> </ul> <p>If the dictionary contains an entry for <code>cat</code>, it will successfully match the 2nd looked up string, (as shown in the image). Note the \ud83e\udde9 symbol and the <code>plural</code> rule.</p> <p>However, this rule will also match the word \"reads\", and show the verb \"read\" from the dictionary, marked as being <code>plural</code>. This makes no sense, and we can use conditions to prevent it. Let's add a condition and use it in the rule.</p> <pre><code>conditions: {\n  n: {\n    name: 'Noun',\n    isDictionaryForm: true,\n  },\n},\ntransforms: {\n  \"plural\": {\n    name: \"plural\",\n    description: \"Plural form of a noun\",\n    rules: [\n      suffixInflection(\"s\", \"\", [], [\"n\"])\n    ],\n  },\n},\n</code></pre> <p>Now, only dictionary entries marked with the same \"n\" condition will be eligible for matching the <code>plural</code> rule. The verb \"read\" should be marked as \"v\" in the dictionary, and will no longer be matched by the <code>plural</code> rule. The entries in the dictionary need to be marked with the exact same conditions defined in the <code>conditions</code> object. The <code>isDictionaryForm</code> field can be set to <code>false</code>, to allow some conditions to be used only in between rules, and not in the dictionary. In most cases however, it will be set to <code>true</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now consider the word <code>dogs'</code>, as in the <code>the dogs' bones</code>. This is the possessive of a plural noun. We can add a rule for the possessive:</p> <pre><code>{\n  name: \"possessive\",\n  description: \"Possessive form of a noun\",\n  rules: [\n    suffixInflection(\"'\", \"\", [], [\"n\"])\n  ],\n},\n</code></pre> <p>However, the only <code>conditionOut</code> of this rule, <code>n</code>, does not match any <code>conditionIn</code> of the <code>plural</code> rule, because the <code>plural</code> rules <code>conditionsIn</code> are an empty array. To fix this, we can add a condition to the <code>plural</code> rule:</p> <pre><code>{\n  name: \"plural\",\n  description: \"Plural form of a noun\",\n  rules: [\n    suffixInflection(\"s\", \"\", [\"n\"], [\"n\"])\n  ],\n},\n</code></pre> <p>Now the rules will chain together, as shown in the image. Chaining can be very useful (for agglutinative languages it is indispensable), but may cause unexpected behavior. For example, <code>boss</code> will now display results for the word <code>bo</code> (e.g. the staff) with the <code>plural</code> rule applied twice, i.e. it can chain with itself because the <code>conditionsIn</code> and <code>conditionsOut</code> are the same. This leads us to the actual implementation of the <code>plural</code> rule in <code>english-transforms.js</code>:</p> <pre><code>conditions: {\n  n: {\n    name: \"Noun\",\n    isDictionaryForm: true,\n    subConditions: [\"np\", \"ns\"],\n  },\n  np: {\n    name: \"Noun plural\",\n    isDictionaryForm: true,\n  },\n  ns: {\n    name: \"Noun singular\",\n    isDictionaryForm: true,\n  },\n},\ntransforms: {\n  \"plural\": {\n    name: \"plural\",\n    description: \"Plural form of a noun\",\n    rules: [\n      suffixInflection(\"s\", \"\", [\"np\"], [\"ns\"])\n    ],\n  },\n},\n</code></pre> <p>Since <code>ns</code> and <code>np</code> are subconditions of <code>n</code> they will both match with <code>n</code>, but not with each other. This covers all of the requirements we have considered.</p> <p>The <code>suffixInflection</code> is one of a few helper functions - you can write more complex rules, using regex and a function for deinflecting. There are examples of this across the language transforms files.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/language-features/#writing-deinflection-tests","title":"Writing Deinflection Tests","text":"<p>Now that you have added a couple deinflection rules, you might want to start writing some tests to check if the deinflections are behaving correctly.

Our test file should look like this:</p> english-transforms.test.js<pre><code>import { englishTransforms } from \"../../ext/js/language/en/english-transforms.js\";\nimport { LanguageTransformer } from \"../../ext/js/language/language-transformer.js\";\nimport { testLanguageTransformer } from \"../fixtures/language-transformer-test.js\";\n\nconst tests = [\n  {\n    category: \"plurals and possessive\",\n    valid: true,\n    tests: [\n      { term: \"cat\", source: \"cats\", rule: \"ns\", reasons: [\"plural\"] },\n      { term: \"cat\", source: \"cat's\", rule: \"ns\", reasons: [\"possessive\"] },\n      {\n        term: \"cat\",\n        source: \"cats'\",\n        rule: \"ns\",\n        reasons: [\"plural\", \"possessive\"],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\nconst languageTransformer = new LanguageTransformer();\nlanguageTransformer.addDescriptor(englishTransforms);\ntestLanguageTransformer(languageTransformer, tests);\n</code></pre> <p>The part we want to examine is the <code>test</code> array.

Here, we used <code>ns</code> because <code>cat</code> is a singular noun.</li> <li><code>reasons</code> represents the chain of deinflection rules needed to get from <code>source</code> to <code>term</code>.</li> </ul> <p>You can check that all the tests pass by running <code>npm run test:unit</code>.</p> <p>This command runs all Yomitan unit test files. To only run a single test file, you can instead opt for <code>npx vitest &lt;file-name&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Now, we may want to verify that <code>boss</code> really does not deinflect to <code>bo</code>. You can add to the <code>tests</code> array:</p> <pre><code>{\n    category: 'invalid deinflections',\n    valid: false,\n    tests: [\n        {term: 'boss', source: 'bo', rule: 'ns', reasons: ['plural', 'plural']},\n    ],\n},\n</code></pre> <p>Here, by setting <code>valid</code> to <code>false</code>, we are telling the test function to fail this test case if only <code>boss</code> deinflects to <code>bo</code> with the <code>ns</code> condition under a double <code>plural</code> rule.</p> <p>You can also optionally pass a <code>preprocess</code> helper function to <code>testLanguageTransformer</code>.

For Yomitan to work properly, the recommended permissions must be explicitly set. In the Yomitan welcome page, go to the <code>Recommended Permissions (Important)</code> section and check <code>Enable recommended permissions</code>.</p> <p>I'm having problems importing dictionaries in Firefox, what do I do?</p> <p>Yomitan uses the cross-browser IndexedDB system for storing imported dictionary data into your user profile. Although everything \"just works\" in Chrome, depending on settings, Firefox users can run into problems due to browser bugs. Yomitan catches errors and tries to offer suggestions about how to work around Firefox issues, but in general at least one of the following solutions should work for you:</p> <ul> <li>Make sure you have cookies enabled. It appears that disabling them also disables IndexedDB for some reason. You   can still have cookies be disabled on other sites; just make sure to add the Yomitan extension to the whitelist of   whatever tool you are using to restrict cookies. You can get the extension \"URL\" by looking at the address bar when   you have the search page open.</li> <li>Make sure that you have sufficient disk space available on the drive Firefox uses to store your user profile.   Firefox limits the amount of space that can be used by IndexedDB to a small fraction of the disk space actually   available on your computer.</li> <li>Make sure that you have history set to \"Remember history\" enabled in your privacy settings. When this option is   set to \"Never remember history\", IndexedDB access is once again disabled for an inexplicable reason.</li> <li>As a last resort, try using the Refresh Firefox   feature to reset your user profile. It appears that the Firefox profile system can corrupt itself preventing   IndexedDB from being accessible to Yomitan.</li> </ul> <p>Will you add support for online dictionaries?</p> <p>Online dictionaries will not be implemented because it is not possible to support them in a robust way. In order to perform deinflection, Yomitan must execute dozens of database queries for every single word. Factoring in network latency and the fragility of web scraping, it would not be possible to maintain a good and consistent user experience.</p> <p>Is it possible to use Yomitan with files saved locally on my computer with Chrome?</p> <p>In order to use Yomitan with local files in Chrome, you must first tick the Allow access to file URLs checkbox for Yomitan on the extensions page. Due to the restrictions placed on browser addons in the WebExtensions model, it will likely never be possible to use Yomitan with PDF files.</p> <p>Is it possible to delete individual dictionaries without purging the database?</p> <p>Yomitan is able to delete individual dictionaries, but keep in mind that this process can be very slow and can cause the browser to become unresponsive. The time it takes to delete a single dictionary can sometimes be roughly the same as the time it originally took to import, which can be significant for certain large dictionaries.</p> <p>Why aren't EPWING dictionaries bundled with Yomitan?</p> <p>The vast majority of EPWING dictionaries are proprietary, so they are unfortunately not able to be included in this extension due to copyright reasons.</p>"},{"location":"other/permissions/","title":"Yomitan Permissions","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>    Yomitan requires access to all URLs in order to run scripts to scan text and show the definitions popup,   request audio for playback and download, and connect with Anki.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>storage</code> and <code>unlimitedStorage</code>    Yomitan uses storage permissions in order to save extension settings and dictionary data.   <code>unlimitedStorage</code> is used to help prevent web browsers from unexpectedly   deleting dictionary data.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>declarativeNetRequest</code>    Yomitan uses this permission to ensure certain requests have valid and secure headers.
