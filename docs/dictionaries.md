You must download and import the dictionaries you wish to use in order to enable Yomitan definition lookups.

There are several free dictionaries available for Yomitan, some of them with glossaries available in different languages.

Be aware that non-English dictionaries generally contain fewer entries than their English counterparts. Even if your primary language is not English, you may consider also importing the English version for better coverage.

??? note "EPWING Dictionaries"

    Yomitan supports dictionaries in the esoteric but popular [EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) format. They were often utilized in portable electronic dictionaries. These dictionaries are often sought after by language learners for their correctness and excellent coverage of the Japanese language.

    Unfortunately, as most of the dictionaries released in this format are proprietary, you will need to procure these dictionaries yourself and import them using [Yomitan Import](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan-import). Check the project page for additional details.

### Importing and Exporting Personal Configuration
