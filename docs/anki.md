## Anki Integration

Yomitan features automatic flashcard creation for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a free application designed to help you
retain knowledge. This feature requires the prior installation of an Anki plugin called [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect).
Check the respective project page for more information about how to set up this software.

### Flashcard Configuration

Before flashcards can be automatically created, you must configure the templates used to create term and/or kanji notes.
If you are unfamiliar with Anki deck and model management, this would be a good time to reference the [Anki
Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/). In short, you must specify what information should be included in the
flashcards that Yomitan creates through AnkiConnect.

Flashcard fields can be configured with the following steps:

1.  Open the Yomitan options page and scroll down to the section labeled _Anki Options_.
2.  Tick the checkbox labeled _Enable Anki integration_ (Anki must be running with [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) installed).
3.  Select the type of template to configure by clicking on either the _Terms_ or _Kanji_ tabs.
4.  Select the Anki deck and model to use for new creating new flashcards of this type.
5.  Fill the model fields with markers corresponding to the information you wish to include (several can be used at
    once).
6.  _(optional, advanced)_ Users can also configure the actual [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates used to create
    the flashcard contents.

When creating your model for Yomitan, _make sure that you pick a unique field to be first_; fields that will
contain `{expression}` or `{character}` are ideal candidates for this. Anki does not allow duplicate flashcards to be
added to a deck by default; it uses the first field in the model to check for duplicates. For example, if you have `{reading}`
configured to be the first field in your model and <ruby>橋<rt>はし</rt></ruby> is already in your deck, you will not
be able to create a flashcard for <ruby>箸<rt>はし</rt></ruby> because they share the same reading.

### Flashcard Creation

Once Yomitan is configured, it becomes trivial to create new flashcards with a single click. You will see the following
icons next to term definitions:

- Clicking ![](assets/btn/btn-add-expression.png) adds the current expression (e.g. 食べる).
- Clicking ![](assets/btn/btn-add-reading.png) adds the current expression's reading (e.g. たべる).

If _Check for card duplicates_ is on, and a card for the current definition already exists in the deck, you will see the book icon.
If _When a duplicate is detected_ is set to `Prevent adding`, the icons will appear grayed out. If set to `Allow adding`, the icons will change to:

- ![](assets/btn/btn-add-duplicate-expression.png): to add the expression
- ![](assets/btn/btn-add-duplicate-reading.png): to add the reading

Below are some troubleshooting tips you can try if you are unable to create new flashcards:

- If all of the buttons appear grayed out, then you should double-check your deck and model configuration settings.
- If no icons appear at all, make sure that Anki is running in the background and that [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) has been installed.

### Anki Note Generation

Using the `Generate Anki Notes (Experimental)...` feature in the settings page it is possible to easily generate and export large amounts of Anki cards.

!!! WARNING "This feature is experimental!"

First, get a newline separated list of terms. For example:

```
雪
雨
竜巻
```

Enter this list into the large text box in the `Anki Note Generator` popup window.

Next, select either `Send to Anki` or `Export to File`.

**Send to Anki:**

`Send to Anki` will send all the terms to the active Anki deck using the active Anki model specified on the page. To change the active Anki deck or Anki model, edit them in the `Configure Anki card format...` setting.

Make sure to confirm you are exporting to the correct deck and with the correct Anki model. After the notes are sent to Anki there is no way to automatically undo the changes.

To include media in notes sent to Anki, make sure to enable the `Add media to notes` option. Media includes audio, images, and svgs. Exporting with media may take significantly longer than without it.

To prevent duplicate notes being sent to Anki, enable the `Prevent sending duplicate notes` option. This will check for duplicate notes that already exist. The `Check for duplicates across all models` and `Duplicate card scope` settings are used to determine what is considered a duplicate card. **This does not remove duplicates in the term list.**

**Export to File:**

`Export to File` will export all the terms to an Anki deck file using the active Anki card format specified on the page and in Anki's `Notes in plain text (.txt)` format. After exporting completes you will be prompted to save the file. This file can later be imported into Anki.

Media cannot be included when exporting in this format.
